# poet [![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/poet-theme-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/poet-theme)
A light emacs theme that's well suited for prose: particularly org-mode and markdown-mode; or any mode that works well with `variable-pitch` mode.

## Motivation
The main idea behind this was to make Emacs more friendly for writing prose instead of code. Highlights include mixing monospace and variable pitch text in markdown and org-modes, making it convenient to write prose and code together. For example,

## Set up
- **Installation**:
  - **Melpa**: Make sure [melpa is in your package archives list](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started), and <kbd>M-x</kbd> `package-install poet-theme`
  - **Manual**: Download the theme to your `custom-theme-directory` which defaults to `~/emacs.d`.
- **Variable-pitch-mode**: Adding variable pitch mode to text modes will help in rendering mixed fonts every time you edit  markdown, org-mode, etc.
```
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (variable-pitch-mode 1)))
```
- **Custom fonts**: Choose your fonts/font sizes before loading the theme with
```
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Iosevka" :height 130)
    (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Iosevka")
    (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Baskerville")
```
- **Mac OSX Title Bar**: Only for **Emacs 26.1**
```
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . light))
```
- **Additional useful modes**: Some modes I like to enable/disable
```
    (olivetti-mode 1)        ;; Centers text in the buffer
    (flyspell-mode 1)        ;; Catch Spelling mistakes
    (typo-mode 1)            ;; Good for symbols like em-dash

    (blink-cursor-mode 0)    ;; Reduce visual noise
    (linum-mode 0)           ;; No line numbers for prose

    (setq org-bullets-bullet-list
        '("◉" "○"))
    (org-bullets 1)
```
