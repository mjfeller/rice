Installation

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d.

        git clone https://gitlab.com/mark.feller/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, packages will be downloaded and
installed via the public repos. If you encounter any errors at that stage, try
restarting Emacs, and possibly running 'M-x package-refresh-contents' before
doing so. After successfully installing packages future startups will be much
faster.

There are several subdirectories:

'core'         holds primary configuration that I feel lost without.
'elpa'         holds vendored packages from package.el.
'etc'          holds configuration files for packages, files often written to
               like bookmarks.el, and the custom.el file used when configuring
               emacs through the customization interface.
'lisp'         holds custom user lisp code. Useful for personal packages,
               personal information, etc.
'modules'      holds package/language specific configuration that is useful when
               working with specific tasks or within specific languages, but are
               not needed generally.
'src'          holds the Emacs source directory for jumping to definition and
               viewing docs within the C code.
'snippets'     holds Yasnippet snippets.
'theme'        holds theme packages. Poet is my current goto.

Disclaimer

This is an everchanging and evolving Emacs configuration for my personal use. I
see this repo more as a collection of ideas to be incorporated into your own
configurations.
