The hung up sign up on our town
If you live it up you won't live it down
So she left Mario son
Just like a bullet that leaves a gun
A charcoal eyes and a morrow hips
She went and took that california trip
The moon was clothe red hair like wrench
Don't look back just come on check
Oh you gotta hold on, hold on
You gotta hold on take my hand
Stay right here, gotta hold on
Well he gave her a dice or a watch
And a ring made from a spoon
Everyone's looking for someone to blame
When you share my bed you share my name
So go ahead and call the cops
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby I still love you
Sometimes there's nothing left to do
Oh you gotta hold on, hold on
You gotta hold on take my hand
Stay right here, gotta hold on
God bless your crocked little heart
Saint Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken child voice
How I wish you were still here with me
Oh you build it up you wreck it down
And you burn you mansion to the ground
When there's nothing left to keep you here
When you're falling behind in this big blue world
Oh you gotta hold on, hold on
You gotta hold on take my hand
Stay right here, gotta hold on
Down by the river side motel
It's tent will own and fall in
By the 99 cents store
She closed her eyes and started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way
When it's cold and there's no music
And your whole hometown it's far away
And inside your head the record's playing
A song called hold on, hold on
You gotta hold on
Take my hand, stay right here you gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, hold on , you gotta hold on
Take my hand, stay right here you gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, hold on , you gotta hold on
Take my hand, stay right here you gotta hold on
